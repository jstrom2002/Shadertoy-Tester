# Shadertoy-Tester
OpenGL program to quickly load and test Shadertoy's shaders on my machine.
Somewhat hastily slapped together, only uses the default framebuffer.
Also, this is very not cross-platform, its set up to work on my Windows pc only so it might require so additional defines.
Requires glfw3.
